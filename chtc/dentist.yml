# --join-policy: Choose according to your needs:
#
# scaffoldGaps: Closes only gaps that are marked by Ns in the assembly.
#   This is the default mode of operation. Use this if you do not want to
#   alter the scaffolding of the assembly. See also --existing-gap-bonus.
# scaffolds: Allows whole scaffolds to be joined in addition to the effects
#   of scaffoldGaps. Use this if you have (many) scaffolds that are not yet
#   full chromosome-scale.
# contigs: Allows contigs to be rearranged freely. This is especially useful
#   in de novo assemblies before applying any other scaffolding methods as it
#   increases the contiguity thus increasing the chance that large-scale
#   scaffolding (e.g. Bionano or Hi-C) finds proper joins.
